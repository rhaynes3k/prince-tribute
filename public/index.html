                        Prince was born Prince Rogers Nelson on June 7, 1958, in Minneapolis, Minnesota to musical parents, John Nelson, a musician and Mattie Shaw, a jazz singer, of the Prince Rogers band. He taught himself to play piano at 7, guitar at 13, and drums at 14.

                        In high school, Prince formed his first band Grand Central (later known as Champagne) with André Anderson (who later changed his name to André Cymone) and Morris Day. He suffered from epileptic seizures, and was teased a lot in school. As a coping mechanism,
                        he tried to compensate by being as flashy and loud as possible.

                        In 1978, becoming the youngest signed producer at Warner Bros., Prince dropped his debut album, For You, which was followed by Prince (1979). He played practically all of the instruments on his first 5 albums. His sophomore release contained his first
                        top 20 pop hit, the easygoing "I Wanna Be Your Lover" as well as "Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?"

                        In 1980, he dropped the critically acclaimed Dirty Mind laced with graphic sexual undertones on tunes such as Head, Sister, and the title track Dirty Mind. One of its cleaner songs, "Uptown", made it to number 5 on the R&B charts. The song, "When You
                        Were Mine" became his most widely covered song; sung by such artists as Mitch Ryder and Cyndi Lauper.

                        1981 brought us the album Controversy. This album continued with sexy themed tracks such as "Sexuality" and "Do Me Baby". The title track, Controversy, reached number 3 on the R&B charts and 70 on the Pop charts. Prince, Dirty Mind, and Controversy all
                        eventually went platinum.

                        In 1982, Prince released a double album entitled 1999 that gave him star status. Packed with hits like "Little Red Corvette"(No. 6), "Delirious"(No. 8), and the title song, "1999"(No. 12), the album was easily pushed to platinum status. "Little Red Corvette"
                        was among the first videos by a Black performer to be played regularly on MTV.

                        In 1984, he reached super-stardom with Purple Rain, a seemingly autobiographical movie set in his home town of Minneapolis. It, as well as the soundtrack album was an enormous hit. The album spent 24 weeks at the top of the charts, and sold over 13 million
                        copies. Singles include "Let's go Crazy"(No. 1), "When Doves Cry"(No. 1), "Purple Rain"(No. 2), "I Would Die 4 U"(No. 8), and "Take Me With U"(No. 25). He won a grammy in 1985 for Best Group Rock Vocal for "Purple Rain" as well
                        as R&B Song of the Year for "I Feel For You" by Chaka Khan(originally from his second album Prince in 1979). He also won the Best Original Score Oscar for Purple Rain in 1985.

                        Along the way, Prince discovered and/or developed several other musical sensations such as Sheila E, daughter of Santana percussionist, Pete Escovedo; The Time, led by long time friend, Morris Day; Vanity 6(later named Apollonia 6 when Vanity left for
                        a solo career). He has also penned hits for many artists including Sheena Easton, Patti Labelle, and so many others under various pseudonyms.

                        The psychedelic Around the World in a Day followed Purple Rain in 1985. Although it charted for an impressive 3 weeks, it was viewed as a commercial disappointment. Some charting singles included the ever-popular "Raspberry Beret"(No. 2) and "Pop Life"(No.
                        7).

                        The soundtrack album, Parade, for his next movie, Under the Cherry Moon, yeilded one chart-topping hit, "Kiss" in 1986. The movie was considered a flop to critics and viewers.

                        In 1987, Prince fired several members of his band, The Revolution, only keeping Dr. Fink(keyboards). He replaced them with an unnamed band which included Sheila E on drums. The new talent was featured but not credited on Sign O' the Times. This album
                        was regarded as his return to form and his pinnacle piece. It was adorned with hits such as the title track(No. 3), "You Got the Look", a duet with Sheena Easton(No. 2), and "I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man" (No. 10).

                        as the top 5 r&b hit "Partyman."

                    In January 1991, at his recently opened Glam Slam nightclub in Minneapolis, Prince unveiled his new band, the New Power Generation, who would not tour the U.S. until 1993. The band included a rapping dancer (Anthony "Tony M" Mosely), in Prince's first nod to hip-hop, which had claimed a significant share of his black-pop audience and with which he never seemed comfortable musically. Eight months later he released his fifth album in five years, Diamonds and Pearls (No. 3), which spawned hits in the lascivious "Gett Off" (No. 21), "Cream" (No. 1), and the title track (No. 3). Warner Bros. made Prince a vice president when he re-signed with the label in 1992.

                    The following year, he released his 12th album, which was titled with an unpronounceable merger of the male and female gender symbols; its hit singles included "7" (No. 8), "My Name Is Prince" (No. 36), and the profane "Sexy M.F." (No. 66). In September 1993 Prince pulled the most eccentric move of his career: he changed his name to the unpronounceable symbol. In 1994, after becoming embroiled in contract disagreements with Warner Bros. during negotiations for the release of his upcoming album, "Symbol Man," "Glyph," or "The Artist Formerly Known As Prince" — shortened to "the Artist," as he was now known — suffered widespread ridicule and ignited the fierce battle between both sides over artistic and financial control of the singer's works. The Gold Experience, released in 1995, and Chaos and Disorder, release in 1996, fullfilled the terms of his contract with Warner Bros., this ending their turbulent relationship.

                    Meanwhile, the Artist issued the triple-CD set Emancipation (Number Two R&B, 1996) on his own New Power Generation (NPG) label, which was distributed through Capitol/EMI. The album went double platinum, and a remake of the Stylistics' 1972 hit "Betcha By Golly Wow" reached Number Ten on the R&B chart. The Artist also wed Mayte Garcia, a 22-year-old dancer and vocalist in his band. Their son died of a rare disorder called Pfeiffer's Syndrome shortly after birth in November 1996.

                    Culling tracks from his archives, the Artist put out the four-CD compilation Crystal Ball (Number 62 pop, Number 59 R&B) in 1998, which he packaged in a clear plastic ball and marketed through his Web site by offering a fifth bonus disc, the acoustically-based The Truth. It sold 250,000 copies. With Crystal Ball, Prince discovered that it's much more difficult to get records to an audience than it seems; some fans who pre-ordered their copies through Prince's website (from which a bonus fifth disc was included, the acoustically-based The Truth) didn't receive them until months after the set began appearing in stores.

                    A year later, with "1999" predictably an end-of-the-millennium anthem, Prince issued the remix collection 1999 (The New Master). A collection of Warner Bros.-era leftovers, Vault: Old Friends 4 Sale, followed that summer, and in the fall Prince returned on Arista with the all-star Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic. In the fall of 2001 he released the controversial Rainbow Children, a jazz-infused circus of sound trumpeting his conversion to the Jehovah's Witnesses that left many longtime fans out in the cold. He further isolated himself with 2003's N.E.W.S., a four-song set of instrumental jams that sounded a lot more fun to play than to listen to. Prince rebounded in 2003 with the chart-topping Musicology, a return to form that found the artist back in the Top Ten, even garnering a Grammy nomination for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance in 2005.

                    In early 2006 he was the musical guest on Saturday Night Live, performing two songs with a new protégée, R&B singer Tamar. A four-song appearance at the Brit Awards with Wendy, Lisa, and Sheila E. followed. Both appearances previewed tracks from 3121, which hit number one on the album charts soon after its release in March 2006. Planet Earth followed in 2007, featuring contributions from Wendy and Lisa. In the U.K., copies were cover-mounted on the July 15 edition of The Mail on Sunday, provoking Columbia -- the worldwide distributor for the release -- to refuse distribution throughout the U.K. In the U.S., the album was issued on July 24.
                    LotusFlow3r, a three-disc set, arrived in 2009, featuring a trio of distinct albums: LotusFlow3r itself (a guitar showcase), MPLSound (a throwback to his '80s funk output), and Elixer (a smooth contemporary R&B album featuring the breathy vocals of Bria Valente). Despite only being available online and through one big-box retailer, the set debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart. A year later, another throwback-flavored effort, 20Ten, became his second U.K. newspaper giveaway. No official online edition of the album was made available.</p>

                    From mid-2010 through the end of 2012, Prince toured throughout Europe, America, Europe again, Canada, and Australia. During 2013, he released several singles, starting with "Screwdriver" and continuing with "Breakfast Can Wait" in the summer of that year. Early in 2014, he made a cameo appearance on the Zooey Deschanel sitcom The New Girl, appearing in the episode that aired following the Super Bowl. All this activity was prelude to the spring announcement that Prince had re-signed to Warner Bros. Records, the label he had feuded with 20 years prior. As part of the deal, he wound up receiving the ownership of his master recordings, and the label planned a reissue campaign that would begin with an expanded reissue of Purple Rain roughly timed to celebrate its 30th anniversary.</p>

                    First came two new albums: Art Official Age and PlectrumElectrum, the latter credited to 3rdEyeGirl, the all-female power trio that was his new-millennial backing band. Both records came out on the same day in September 2014. (Two years later, the Prince reissue program and the expanded edition of Purple Rain had yet to appear.) Almost a year to the day, he released HITnRUN: Phase One, with contributions from Lianne La Havas, Judith Hill, and Rita Ora. A sequel, HITnRUN: Phase Two, was released online only via Jay Z's streaming service Tidal (the rare streaming service Prince approved of) in December 2015, with a physical release following in January 2016.

                    In early 2016, Prince set out on a rare solo tour, a run of shows he called "Piano and a Microphone." The tour was cut short in April due to sickness, however, and Prince flew home to Minneapolis. On April 21, 2016, police were called to Paisley Park, where they found Prince unresponsive; he died that day at the age of 57. His early death and incredible achievement prompted an outpouring of emotion from fans, friends, influences, and professional associates. On the following week's Billboard charts, he occupied four of the top ten album positions and four of the top singles positions.

                    With the fate of his estate and unpublished music in doubt, many were left wondering how Prince's legacy would continue. But his sister Tyka Nelson said in a statement issued by Bremer Trust, the current managers of the late legendary artist's estate, that Paisley Park would be opened for public tours since it was "something that Prince always wanted to do and was actively working on. ... Only a few hundred people have had the rare opportunity to tour the estate during his lifetime. Now fans from around the world will be able to experience Prince's world for the first time as we open the doors to this incredible place."
