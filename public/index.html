                            Prince was born Prince Rogers Nelson on June 7, 1958, in Minneapolis, Minnesota to musical parents, John Nelson, a musician and Mattie Shaw, a jazz singer, of the Prince Rogers band. He taught himself to play piano at 7, guitar at 13, and drums at 14.

                            In high school, Prince formed his first band Grand Central (later known as Champagne) with André Anderson (who later changed his name to André Cymone) and Morris Day. He suffered from epileptic seizures, and was teased a lot in school. As a coping mechanism, he tried to compensate by being as flashy and loud as possible.

                            In 1978, becoming the youngest signed producer at Warner Bros., Prince dropped his debut album, For You, which was followed by Prince (1979). He played practically all of the instruments on his first 5 albums. His sophomore release contained his first top 20 pop hit, the easygoing "I Wanna Be Your Lover" as well as "Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?"

                            In 1980, he dropped the critically acclaimed Dirty Mind laced with graphic sexual undertones on tunes such as Head, Sister, and the title track Dirty Mind. One of its cleaner songs, "Uptown", made it to number 5 on the R&B charts. The song, "When You Were Mine" became his most widely covered song; sung by such artists as Mitch Ryder and Cyndi Lauper.

                            1981 brought us the album Controversy. This album continued with sexy themed tracks such as "Sexuality" and "Do Me Baby". The title track, Controversy, reached number 3 on the R&B charts and 70 on the Pop charts. Prince, Dirty Mind, and Controversy all eventually went platinum.

                            In 1982, Prince released a double album entitled 1999 that gave him star status. Packed with hits like "Little Red Corvette"(No. 6), "Delirious"(No. 8), and the title song, "1999"(No. 12), the album was easily pushed to platinum status. "Little Red Corvette" was among the first videos by a Black performer to be played regularly on MTV.

                            In 1984, he reached super-stardom with Purple Rain, a seemingly autobiographical movie set in his home town of Minneapolis. It, as well as the soundtrack album was an enormous hit. The album spent 24 weeks at the top of the charts, and sold over 13 million copies. Singles include "Let's go Crazy"(No. 1), "When Doves Cry"(No. 1), "Purple Rain"(No. 2), "I Would Die 4 U"(No. 8), and "Take Me With U"(No. 25). He won a grammy in 1985 for Best Group Rock Vocal for "Purple Rain" as well as R&B Song of the Year for "I Feel For You" by Chaka Khan(originally from his second album Prince in 1979). He also won the Best Original Score Oscar for Purple Rain in 1985.

                            Along the way, Prince discovered and/or developed several other musical sensations such as Sheila E, daughter of Santana percussionist, Pete Escovedo; The Time, led by long time friend, Morris Day; Vanity 6(later named Apollonia 6 when Vanity left for a solo career). He has also penned hits for many artists including Sheena Easton, Patti Labelle, and so many others under various pseudonyms.

                            The psychedelic Around the World in a Day followed Purple Rain in 1985. Although it charted for an impressive 3 weeks, it was viewed as a commercial disappointment. Some charting singles included the ever-popular "Raspberry Beret"(No. 2) and "Pop Life"(No. 7).

                            The soundtrack album, Parade, for his next movie, Under the Cherry Moon, yeilded one chart-topping hit, "Kiss" in 1986. The movie was considered a flop to critics and viewers.

                            In 1987, Prince fired several members of his band, The Revolution, only keeping Dr. Fink(keyboards). He replaced them with an unnamed band which included Sheila E on drums. The new talent was featured but not credited on Sign O' the Times. This album was regarded as his return to form and his pinnacle piece. It was adorned with hits such as the title track(No. 3), "You Got the Look", a duet with Sheena Easton(No. 2), and "I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man" (No. 10).
