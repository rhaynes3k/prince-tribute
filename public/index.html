                            Prince was born Prince Rogers Nelson on June 7, 1958, in Minneapolis, Minnesota to musical parents, John Nelson, a musician and Mattie Shaw, a jazz singer, of the Prince Rogers band. He taught himself to play piano at 7, guitar at 13, and drums at 14.

                            In high school, Prince formed his first band Grand Central (later known as Champagne) with André Anderson (who later changed his name to André Cymone) and Morris Day. He suffered from epileptic seizures, and was teased a lot in school. As a coping mechanism, he tried to compensate by being as flashy and loud as possible.

                            In 1978, becoming the youngest signed producer at Warner Bros., Prince dropped his debut album, For You, which was followed by Prince (1979). He played practically all of the instruments on his first 5 albums. His sophomore release contained his first top 20 pop hit, the easygoing "I Wanna Be Your Lover" as well as "Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?"

                            In 1980, he dropped the critically acclaimed Dirty Mind laced with graphic sexual undertones on tunes such as Head, Sister, and the title track Dirty Mind. One of its cleaner songs, "Uptown", made it to number 5 on the R&B charts. The song, "When You Were Mine" became his most widely covered song; sung by such artists as Mitch Ryder and Cyndi Lauper.

                            1981 brought us the album Controversy. This album continued with sexy themed tracks such as "Sexuality" and "Do Me Baby". The title track, Controversy, reached number 3 on the R&B charts and 70 on the Pop charts. Prince, Dirty Mind, and Controversy all eventually went platinum.

                            In 1982, Prince released a double album entitled 1999 that gave him star status. Packed with hits like "Little Red Corvette"(No. 6), "Delirious"(No. 8), and the title song, "1999"(No. 12), the album was easily pushed to platinum status. "Little Red Corvette" was among the first videos by a Black performer to be played regularly on MTV.

                            In 1984, he reached super-stardom with Purple Rain, a seemingly autobiographical movie set in his home town of Minneapolis. It, as well as the soundtrack album was an enormous hit. The album spent 24 weeks at the top of the charts, and sold over 13 million copies. Singles include "Let's go Crazy"(No. 1), "When Doves Cry"(No. 1), "Purple Rain"(No. 2), "I Would Die 4 U"(No. 8), and "Take Me With U"(No. 25).
